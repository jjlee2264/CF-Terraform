Creating an AWS autoscaling group for EC2 instances. 

I am going to skip the creation of a variety resources such as VPC's, ELB, etc. to stay within the context of the challenge. The.tf's provided is using the assumption that the proper files to run them are also created i.e. declaring security groups, VPC, subnets, etc.
